> ## I have some random ideas
I think people would be kindest if they could understand that in the background we are the same

I mean, our biological system do exactly the same sorts of process in order to express what our bodies are. Look, the ***replication process***, that's the way our cells replicate their DNA, we all do exactly the same thing.

So, simply I can't imagine how do the brain of people, self worshipping people, see the world so they think they can make people less
